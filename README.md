# Module19_Unsupervised_Learning

This repositry contains the files that have been submitted for Challenge Module 19 Unsupervised Learning.

***** Please note ********
In the starter file there is a final visualisation as follows:


# Create a scatter plot using hvPlot by setting 
# `x="price_change_percentage_24h"` and `y="price_change_percentage_7d"`. 
# Color the graph points with the labels found using K-Means and 
# add the crypto name in the `hover_cols` parameter to identify 
# the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

In the rubric detail it gives a different visualisation and then asks to compare with the original data.
"Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="PC1" and y="PC2". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents."



I have used the instruction in the starter code rather than that of the rubric so that a comparison of the two technicquws can be made.
